## Simple Information System Documentation

This is a simple Information System that consists of Users and Admins.

## Used in this project

- Docker
- Python 3
- Flask
- Pymongo
- Image of MongoDB


## Running the Web Service

1. Run the following command to start the containers:
   ```cmd sudo docker-compose up -d ```
   This will create two containers: one for MongoDB and another for the web service.
   That's it! You've successfully set up the Information System and its dependencies.

## LocalHost

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')

## Collections Of The DataBase

1. db = client['DigitalNotes']

2. Users = db['Users']

3. Notes = db['Notes']

4. Admins = db['Admins']


## <p align="center">Registration</p>

**Endpoint:** /register
**Method:**   Post

To successfully register a new user, you need to provide the following JSON data fields:

1. **Email:**    The email address of the user.
2. **Username:** The desired username for the user's account.
3. **Name:**     The full name of the user.
4. **Password:** The password for the user's account.

If any of these fields are missing, the system will generate an appropriate error message indicating which field is missing.

## User Registration Process

1. The web service checks if all required fields are provided and not empty.
2. If all fields are provided, the service searches through the users collection to determine if the given credentials (email or username) already exist in the database.
   ```python
	us1 = Users.find_one({"email":data['email']})
	us2 = Users.find_one({"username":data['username']}) ```
3. In cases where the provided credentials are not locatable within the database, a distinct identifier is generated through the process of hashing the user's email along with a concatenation of 20 randomly generated bytes. Subsequently, a novel JSON entity encompassing the user's pertinent details is meticulously crafted and subsequently preserved within the designated Users collection.
   ```python
	User = {"email": data['email'], "username": data['username'],  "name":data['name'],  "password":data['password']}
        Users.insert_one(User) ```
4. Upon successful registration, a confirmation message is returned.
	```python
	return Response(data['name']+" was added to the MongoDB",status=200,mimetype='application/json')```
5. Upon unsuccesful registration, an error message is returned.
   	```python
	return Response("There is already a user with these inputs",status=200,mimetype='application/json')```


### POSTMAN: 
```json
{
  "email": "pallis@gmail.com",
  "username": "eid3t1c",
  "name": "alex",
  "password": "s3cr3t"
}
```
### CURL:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/register -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{ "email" : "pallis@gmail.com" , "username" : "eid3t1c", "name" : "alex","password" : "s3cr3t"}'
```
## result:
**alex was added to the MongoDB**
		   
## <p align="center">Login</p>

**Endpoint:** /login
**Method:**   Post

To successfully login, you need to provide the following JSON data fields:

1. **Email:**    The email address of the user.
2. **Username:** The desired username for the user's account.
3. **Password:** The password for the user's account.

If any of these fields are missing, the system will generate an appropriate error message indicating which field is missing.

## User Login Process

1. The web service checks if all required fields are provided and not empty.
2. If all fields are provided, the service searches through the users collection to determine if the given credentials (email,username,password) already exist in the database.
   ```python
	us1 = Users.find_one({"email":data['email'],"username" : data['username'],"password" : data['password']}) 
        ad1 = Admins.find_one({"email":data['email'],"username" : data['username'],"password" : data['password']}) ```
3. If the credentials are  found in the database, the proper privilidges are given depending if the credentials were found in the user's collection or the admin's collection.
   ```python
	if us1 != None:
                id = us1["id"]
                flag = 1
                return Response("Access granted for user",status = 200,mimetype="application/json")
            elif ad1 != None:
                id = ad1["id"]
                flag = 2
                return Response("Access granted for admin",status = 200,mimetype="application/json")
4. Upon successful Login, a confirmation message is returned.
	```python
	return Response("Access granted for admin",status = 200,mimetype="application/json")
	return Response("Access granted for user",status = 200,mimetype="application/json")```
5. Upon unsuccesful Login, an error message is returned.
   	```python
	return Response("Either Email,Username or Password is wrong",status = 500,mimetype='application/json')```
    
## User Authentication and Role Management System

The system employs a `flag` variable to manage user authentication and access levels. By default, `flag` is set to 0, allowing access to the "register" and "login" services.

### User Role

- When `flag` is set to 1, it indicates that a user is successfully authenticated and logged in.
- Users with a `flag` value of 1 gain access to features reserved for authenticated users.

### Admin Role

- If `flag` is changed to 2, it signals the authentication of an admin.
- Admins, identified by a `flag` value of 2, enjoy elevated privileges and access to admin-specific functionalities.

### POSTMAN: 
```json
{
  "email": "pallis@gmail.com",
  "username": "eid3t1c",
  "password": "s3cr3t"
}
```
### CURL:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/login -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{ "email" : "pallis@gmail.com" , "username" : "eid3t1c","password" : "s3cr3t"}'
```
## Result:
**Access granted for user**

**Endpoint:** /getUsers
**Method:**   GET

No json data required.

## Get Users process

1. The web service checks if the person is logged in and has admin priviledges.
2. The service finds all users from the Users collection, create a new JSON object for every single of them and add them to an array.
   ```python
	documents = Users.find({})
        us = []
        for document in documents:
            us_temp = {"username" : document['username'],"email" : document['email'],"password" : document['password']}
            us.append(us_temp) ```
3. Upon success an array in the form of JSON is returned.
   ```python
   	return jsonify(us), 200
   	```
### POSTMAN:

- **Step 1:** Specify the version of Docker Compose.
  ```yaml
  version: '2'
- **Step 2:**  Setting Up MongoDB Service
 In this step, we will configure our MongoDB service using a Docker container.
  ```yaml
  services:
   mongodb:
     image: mongo  # This image will be used for the MongoDB container.
     restart: always  # The container will automatically restart in case of errors.
     container_name: mongodb  # The name of our MongoDB container.
     ports:
       - 27017:27017  # Expose port 27017 for MongoDB connections.
     volumes:
       - ./mongodb/data:/data/db  # Store MongoDB data on the host machine.

- **Step 3:**  Setting Up Flask Service

In this section, we'll configure the Flask service using a Docker container.
```yaml
flask-service:
  build:
    context: ./flask-service  # Build the Flask service using the specified context directory.
  restart: always  # Automatically restart the container in case of errors.
  container_name: flask  # Assign a name to the Flask container.
  depends_on:
    - mongodb  # Make sure the Flask service depends on the MongoDB service.
  ports:
    - 5000:5000  # Map port 5000 from the container to the host system.
  environment:
    - "MONGO_HOSTNAME=mongodb"  # Set the MongoDB hostname as an environment variable.
